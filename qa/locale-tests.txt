# Nepali vs Hindi Locale Differences
# These tests verify that fonts produce correct Nepali-specific forms
# when the NEP/ne language tag is active.

# Hindi/default form: zigzag or curved right stroke
# Nepali form: straight vertical bar on the right side

## Digit variations to check (some fonts differ on 5, 8, 9)
५ ८ ९

## Candrabindu frequency
# Nepali uses candrabindu (ँ) more than Hindi
# Verify it is present, correctly positioned, and doesn't collide with matras:
हुँदैन (candrabindu over u-matra)
मैँले (candrabindu over ai-matra)
हाँस्यो (candrabindu over aa-matra)

## Anusvara vs Candrabindu
# Both should render distinctly:
हुँदैन (candrabindu — nasalized vowel)
हुंदैन (anusvara — less preferred in Nepali for this word)

## Locl feature test
# If the font has a locl feature for NEP, these should show Nepali-preferred forms.
# Render with lang=ne and lang=hi, compare:
